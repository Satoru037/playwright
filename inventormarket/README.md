# Inventor Market – Automated QA Suite

## 1. Project Overview

This directory contains the **Playwright Automation Suite** for  
👉 **https://www.inventor.market**

It focuses on **Visual Regression & Core Page Validation**, ensuring that
key pages render consistently across all supported devices.

---

## 2. Architecture

The automation suite follows a **modular and centralized structure** to ensure
maintainability and deterministic visual testing.

| `tests/visual.spec.js`            | Full-page visual regression tests                |
| `tests/smoke.spec.js`             | Smoke tests to verify page availability          |
| `tests/utils/stabilizePage.js`    | Freezes animations, parallax & layout shifts     |
| `tests/utils/stitchImages.js`     | Utility for stitching images (reporting support) |
| `tests/visual.spec.js-snapshots/` | Baseline visual snapshots                        |
