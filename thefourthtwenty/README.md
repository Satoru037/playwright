# The Fourth Twenty – Automated QA Suite

## 1. Project Overview

This directory contains the **Playwright Automation Suite** for  
👉 **https://thefourthtwenty.ca**

It focuses on **Visual Regression & Core Page Validation**, ensuring that
key pages render consistently across all supported devices.

---

## 2. Architecture

The automation suite follows a **modular and centralized structure** to ensure
maintainability and deterministic visual testing.

| File / Folder                     | Description                                        |

| `tests/visual.spec.js`            | Full-page visual regression tests                  |
| `tests/smoke.spec.js`             | Smoke tests to verify page availability            |
| `tests/utils/stabilizePage.js`    | Freezes animations & triggers lazy-loaded sections |
| `tests/visual.spec.js-snapshots/` | Baseline visual snapshots                          |
